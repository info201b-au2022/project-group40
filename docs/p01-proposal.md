## Introduction

Sleep is important in everyone's daily routine. Every night, healthy humans should sleep 7 to 9 hours each night. Sleep maintains psychological health, physical health, and quality of life. It is important to a numerous amount of brain functions, including how nerve cells communicate with each other. It also affects almost every type of issue and system in the body - from brain, heart, lungs, to mood, immune function, metabolism, and disease resistance. But on the other hand, lack of sleep leads to an increase of disorders such as diabetes, depression, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and obesity. Sleep is a dynamic process that can affect our wellbeing.	Throughout our daily routines, there are factors that can affect our sleep. Research has shown that factors such as screen time and exercise can have an impact on one's quality of sleep.

## Research Questions
- How does exercise affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?
- How does screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?
- How does the intersection of exercise and screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?

The three research questions are “How does exercise affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”, “How does screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”, and “How does the intersection of exercise and screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”. Preliminary research revealed multiple studies clearly showing that nighttime exposure to blue light, the light emitted by digital devices, is a powerful suppressant of the hormone melatonin, the sleep hormone. Conversely, research on the effects of exercise on sleep seems to show a positive relationship by improving quality and duration. These questions seek to investigate the impacts of screen time and exercise on sleep, and the intersection of these two factors on sleep.

## Limitations
This project looks into individuals’ nightly sleep quality and quantity as affected by different factors. Although quantity is a quantitative variable that can be objectively measured in hours and minutes, there is more ambiguity in a categorical variable like quality that is measured based on individual opinion. Datasets were obtained from the academic data source Kaggle and are generally credible. However, it cannot accurately represent results for the world’s population, as one data set is limited to U.S. individuals and the remaining two do not provide location details. Individual limitations across datasets include exercise data only from university or university-aged students, a dataset with a relatively small sample size of less than 50, and possible confounding variables that were not accounted for such as age and career.



## Expected Implications
This project investigates how different factors such as screen time and exercise can affect individuals' quality of sleep. Though this project was geared towards an age group for 18-35 year olds, this data can help inform all ages. Data from this project can be taken and positively implemented into the lives of all ages. We want this project to reach students and young adults who do not have a healthy sleeping schedule. We hope that proof from the database will enlighten individuals about how important sleep can be and what they can do to have a better night's rest.
