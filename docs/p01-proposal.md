## Introduction

Sleep is important in everyone's daily routine. Every night, healthy humans should sleep 7 to 9 hours each night. Sleep maintains psychological health, physical health, and quality of life. It is important to a numerous amount of brain functions, including how nerve cells communicate with each other. It also affects almost every type of issue and system in the body - from brain, heart, lungs, to mood, immune function, metabolism, and disease resistance. But on the other hand, lack of sleep leads to an increase of disorders such as diabetes, depression, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and obesity. Sleep is a dynamic process that can affect our wellbeing.	Throughout our daily routines, there are factors that can affect our sleep. Research has shown that factors such as screen time and exercise can have an impact on one's quality of sleep.

## Abstract
We aim to address the question of how various personal behavioral patterns affect the quality and quantity of an individuals’ sleep. Such a question is important to investigate because sleep affects all people and maintaining healthy sleep patterns is important to sustaining a good quality of life. Our project measures the subjective opinion of the quality of one’s sleep by examining individual records of physiological health.

## Problem Domain
**Sociotechnical situation:**
Students are prone to various stresses and can lack the resources to take care of their well-being in a meaningful way, and identifying ways in which students can improve their sleep quality is necessary to maintain good physical and emotional health. It is also important to keep track of sleep quality in students who are still undergoing brain development; this study on the relationship between later school start times and sleep shows that more sleep decreased the amount of at-risk activities teens engaged in, therefore increasing their physical and emotional health. Lastly, quality sleep is heavily correlated to improved academic performance in students, as shown in this study on the relationship between sleep and student achievement.

**Project Framing:**
This project investigates how exercise and digital screentime affects the quality and quantity of sleep in students. These are regarded as factors which can heavily influence the overall quality of one’s sleep.

**Human Values:**
The human values related to this project are the physical and emotional well-being of students, as well as other young adults. The goal of this project is to identify ways in which the health of students can be improved, and to offer solutions to the problem of inadequate sleep quality.

**Direct and Indirect Stakeholders:**
Direct Stakeholders: Students who are impacted by poor sleep quality are directly related to the data presented in our project. Other direct stakeholders include educators or counselors, whose sleep quality may be impacted by the potentially negative elements of educational systems.
Indirect Stakeholders: The indirect stakeholders are prospective students who are not yet impacted by poor sleep quality, but who may be in the future. Likewise, people who exercise or who have larger screentime estimates are applicable to the data, despite not necessarily being students.

**Harms and Benefits:**
Benefits: Our data can be used to encourage students to sleep more, and can also be used to identify flaws in the education system which prevent students from obtaining the sleep they need). Additionally, students who view our data could alter their lifestyle to obtain the health benefits related to better sleep quality.
Harms: Some of the data sets take data from students with accessories such as apple watches or other digital trackers. The measurements of screentime also demand that the students have enough economic security to afford the devices required for the data sets. Measuring samples from students also disregards the data of similarly aged individuals who aren’t able to attend school, but who might be affected by the same problems.

## Research Questions
- How does exercise affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?
- How does screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?
- How does the intersection of exercise and screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?

The three research questions are “How does exercise affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”, “How does screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”, and “How does the intersection of exercise and screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”. Preliminary research revealed multiple studies clearly showing that nighttime exposure to blue light, the light emitted by digital devices, is a powerful suppressant of the hormone melatonin, the sleep hormone. Conversely, research on the effects of exercise on sleep seems to show a positive relationship by improving quality and duration. These questions seek to investigate the impacts of screen time and exercise on sleep, and the intersection of these two factors on sleep. They are especially important to people experiencing poor sleep, as the questions can help guide them to address what is causing it and take steps towards sleeping better, perhaps by exercising more and limiting screen time before bed.

## Dataset
The dataset we have chosen is a collection of the result of a survey of general questions relating to sleep quality. The person who collected the data, Krupa Gajjar via Kaggle, interviewed many participants.
He collected general demographic information from each participant, such as their age and gender, and other factors that potentially could impact sleep quality, such as meals eaten per day, whether they have a physical illness, their screen time, whether they use a blue light filter, what direction they sleep, whether they exercise or smoke or drink, and what their beverage of choice is (e.g. tea or coffee). Finally, he collected the hours that each participant slept to determine whether certain factors may combine to impact sleep quality, determined by hours slept.
Since our research questions pertain to how exercise, screen time, and the intersection of both impact sleep quality within adults, the dataset will prove useful in determining the correlation between certain extents of screen time and exercise and how many hours each participant slept in a night.
The research carried out the study to purely analyze sleep patterns of a variety of people and was not funded in any way,  however many other companies such as those promoting exercise equipment or teas may benefit from the research by promoting their products in response to the research’s results. Since the data collection was done independently, it has a fair chance of being credible and trustworthy, especially since it is within the public domain for all to use and potentially critique.
We obtained the source of the data by browsing through Kaggle for any dataset relating to sleep that seemed extensive enough. There were 46 participants surveyed which, although is a low number, is a good starting point while we gather many other datasets to analyze; there are also 11 variables.
We can ensure that the data is very secure and accurate also because of its level of anonymization. The names of each participant are withheld from the dataset and the demographic information is broad enough so that the identities of each participant cannot be revealed. Thus, because of this level of anonymization, participants are more likely to be truthful and not withhold any information that may be viewed as unhealthy, such as low levels of exercise and long lengths of screen time.

## Limitations
This project looks into individuals’ nightly sleep quality and quantity as affected by different factors. Firstly, although quantity is a quantitative variable that can be objectively measured in hours and minutes, there is more ambiguity in a categorical variable like quality that is measured based on individual opinion. This can be solved by assigning quantifying the categorical variables, for example by having respondents rank their opinion on a numerical scale, like one to five. Secondly, datasets were obtained from the academic data source Kaggle and are generally credible. However, it cannot accurately represent results for the world’s population, as one data set is limited to U.S. individuals and the remaining two do not provide location details. Individual limitations across datasets include exercise data only from university or university-aged students, a dataset with a relatively small sample size of less than 50, and possible confounding variables that were not accounted for such as age and career. A possible solution is finding more data sets to increase the sample size, or limit samples to data sets that are as similar as possible and using the same experimental variables.

## Expected Implications
<<<<<<< HEAD
This project investigates how different factors such as screen time and exercise can affect individuals' quality of sleep. Though this project was geared towards an age group for 18-35 year olds, this data can help inform all ages. Data from this project can be taken and positively implemented into the lives of all ages. We want this project to reach students and young adults who do not have a healthy sleeping schedule. We hope that proof from the database will enlighten individuals about how important sleep can be and what they can do to have a better night's rest.
