## Research Questions
How does exercise affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?
How does screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?
How does the intersection of exercise and screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?

The three research questions are “How does exercise affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”, “How does screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”, and “How does the intersection of exercise and screen time affect nightly sleep quality and quantity for adults?”. Preliminary research revealed multiple studies clearly showing that nighttime exposure to blue light, the light emitted by digital devices, is a powerful suppressant of the hormone melatonin, the sleep hormone. Conversely, research on the effects of exercise on sleep seems to show a positive relationship by improving quality and duration. These questions seek to investigate the impacts of screen time and exercise on sleep, and the intersection of these two factors on sleep.

## Limitations
This project looks into individuals’ nightly sleep quality and quantity as affected by different factors. Although quantity is a quantitative variable that can be objectively measured in hours and minutes, there is more ambiguity in a categorical variable like quality that is measured based on individual opinion. Datasets were obtained from the academic data source Kaggle and are generally credible. However, it cannot accurately represent results for the world’s population, as one data set is limited to U.S. individuals and the remaining two do not provide location details. Individual limitations across datasets include exercise data only from university or university-aged students, a dataset with a relatively small sample size of less than 50, and possible confounding variables that were not accounted for such as age and career.
