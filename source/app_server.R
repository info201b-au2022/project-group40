Research showed that China had the first confirmed case. After that, there were confirmed cases in Iran, Italy, and South Korea. Shortly after, there was a major outbreak in cases all around the world. Covid-19 has affected everyone on earth. Whether it be directly or indirectly. Research shows that as of October, 10,2020, more than 7.7 million people across all the states of the US have tested positive for the virus. With that, the New York Timesâ€™s database showed that at least 213,876 people have passed away due to the virus in the United states. Covid-19 has been taking lives on a large scale and it makes us wonder, do different social identities play a role?"
